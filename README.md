# üìùProblem Statement

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to broaden their travel options and offer a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb has evolved into a one-of-a-kind service that is used and recognised throughout the world. Data analysis on millions of Airbnb postings is a critical aspect for the organisation. There is a lot of data generated by these millions of listings. Our job is to evaluate the data so that it may be used for security, business choices, knowledge of customer and provider (host) behaviour and performance on the platform, leading marketing campaigns, implementing creative extra services, and much more.

# üå± Some Exciting Glimpse of the Visuals:

# üí° Conclusions


* Major number of hostings are from Manhattan and Brooklyn from the listing of airbnb New York city whereas Staten Island and Bronx are way too less populous in terms of hostings.One reason for this can be Manhattan is one of the most attracted tourism borough in NewYork called to be as Heart of NewYork city and Brooklyn follows after Manhattan.

* Number of neighbourhood is highest in Queens and lowest in Manhattan still Manhattan has most no. of rentals.

* Many hostings in Manhattan and Brooklyn has been bunched around the same neighbourhood. Thus having most hostings without having much of neighbourhoods.

* Average price of rentals is higher in Manhattan and Brooklyn follows after it. Reason can be tourism again

* Among top 20 neighbourhoods in terms of no. of rentals available most of these neighbourhood belongs to Manhattan borough. Although If looking for top 3 densely hosted neighbourhood top 2 belongs to Brooklyn.

* Airbnb NYC has rentals that charges as high as 10,000 Dollar whereas if we see the average, most of the rentals have prices under 300 Dollar.

* Entire homes are one of the most available rental in New York City whereas shared room are very less preferable.

* For the three room types, average price of entire home is around $150, for shared room is around 50 Dollar, and for private room is around 75 Dollar.
Manhattan is most expensive borough in each of the room types, Brooklyn follows Manhattan, then Queens and Staten Island and Bronx are somewhere at same place.

* Most of the busiest hosts(hosts with most no. of rentals) belongs to Manhattan.

* Most hosts has single rentals only. Although there are also such host having rentals as high as 327, then in 200s, 100s and 50s but general population in our dataset has 1 only.

* Financial District neighbourhood of Manhattan is the one where all busiest hosts mostly have their hostings.

* Price seems to be very lessly relatable with number of reviews although it seems out that one with more number of reviews are having lesser prices.

* Rentals whose availabilty is less than 90 days are generally the ones with lower prices.

* There are many rentals with no availability, on further analysing we get these are the rentals with minimum prices, this might be reason for no availabilty as these are pre booked by the customers.

* All in all in terms of hosts we can say for planning a new hosting they should try to look for Manhattan and Brooklyn and also try to keep minimum nights as 1 and also try to provide private room or entire home instead of shared rooms.
