# üìùProblem Statement

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to broaden their travel options and offer a more unique, personalised way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb has evolved into a one-of-a-kind service that is used and recognised throughout the world. Data analysis on millions of Airbnb postings is a critical aspect for the organisation. There is a lot of data generated by these millions of listings. Our job is to evaluate the data so that it may be used for security, business choices, knowledge of customer and provider (host) behaviour and performance on the platform, leading marketing campaigns, implementing creative extra services, and much more.
